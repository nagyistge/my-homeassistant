# Home Assistant Configuration

This is my personal configuration for a server running on my Mac Mini. I am fairly new to "smart home" accessories and "home automation" so expect this to grow as I acquire more gadgets for a home I am renting in, lol.

# Devices
This config currently uses the folllowing devices (Australian URLs):

- [WeMo LED Lighting Starter Kit](http://www.belkin.com/au/p/P-F5Z0489/) (2 lights + WeMo Link)
- 1 x [WeMo Insight Switch](http://www.belkin.com/au/F7C029-Belkin/p/P-F7C029)
- 1 x [Apple TV 4th Generation](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv) (only 4th gen available)
- 2 x [Google Chromecast 1st Generation](https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_2015?hl=en-AU) (only 2nd gen available)

# Software
The configuration also makes use of these programs or custom components:

- [HA Custom UI](https://github.com/andrey-git/home-assistant-custom-ui)
- [HA History Stats](https://github.com/bokub/ha-history-stats)
