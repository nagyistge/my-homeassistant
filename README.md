# Home Assistant Configuration

This is my personal configuration for a server running on my Mac Mini. I am fairly new to "smart home" accessories and "home automation" so expect this to grow as I acquire more gadgets for a home I am renting in, lol.

There are various configurations available to look at based on different living situations, feel free to browse the different branches for snapshots of previous configurations.

# Devices
This config currently uses the following devices (Australian URLs):

- 1 x LIFX+ A19 Wi-Fi LED Light with Night Vision
- 1 x WeMo Insight Switch
- 1 x Apple TV 4th Generation
- 2 x Google Chromecast 1st Generation
- 2 x Google Chromecast Audio
- 1 x Google Home


# Things I would like to do next:
- [x] Measure bandwidth usage
- [ ] Show it on the frontend
- [ ] Get Xiaomi devices (Temp/Humidity sensors, Wireless Buttons at least) for context-sensitive automations
- [ ] Automate devices based on temperature (make sure heater doesn't turn on when too warm etc)
- [ ] Experiment with Bayesian Binary Sensors to capture/predict things (like sleep)

# Contact
The best way to get in contact with me regarding this configuration is to create an issue or PR here on Github.
