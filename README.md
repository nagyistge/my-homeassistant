# Home Assistant Configuration

This is my personal configuration for a server running on my Mac Mini. I am fairly new to "smart home" accessories and "home automation" so expect this to grow as I acquire more gadgets for a home I am renting in, lol.

# Devices
This config currently uses the folllowing devices:

- WeMo LED Lighting Starter Kit (2 lights + WeMo Link)
- WeMo Insight Switch
- 1 x Apple TV 4th Generation
- 2 x Google Chromecast 1st Generation

# Software
The configuration also makes use of these programs or custom components:

- andrey-git/home-assistant-custom-ui
- bokub/ha-history-stats

# Things I would like to do next:
- [ ] Security cameras / "dog cam"
- [ ] Figure out weather radar "camera"
- [ ] Look at this Z-Wave thing?
